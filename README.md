# A function I wrote for Studio II

We have multiple game objects holding different audio sources, and we want to be able to turn off/on each object's audio individually, and toggle on/off all audio with the following conditions:

If there is a single audio playing, press space to mute all audio sources.
If there is no audio playing, press space to unmute all audio sources.

If E is pressed and mouse is over an individual game object, turn on or off that object's audio source.

The mute/unmute all objects' audio took me longer to figure out. But it used the for loop and I'm proud of myself.
